### Deleted files
* what happens to file contents when a file is deleted
* what else happens (specifically in FAT?)

---

### Deleted files
* what else happens (specifically in FAT?)
    * first character in filename changed to `0xe5`
    * all clusters in FAT replaced with `0x00`

> why are these important

{{% /section %}}

### NTFS
{{% section %}}
* $MFT (DEs of NTFS)
* $BITMAP (FATs of NTFS)

* Everything is a fileâ„¢
* Everything in a file is an attribute

---

### Extents
* Similar to Cluster Runs
* A contiguous area of storage reserved for a file

---

### Alternative data streams
* Also a file attribute
* Honestly pretty stupid, not honored by other FSs
    * Originally used to provide compatibility with Macs
    * Now mostly used to hide malware lol

### Deleted files
* what happens for NTFS

{{% /section %}}

---

### Deleted files
* what happens for NTFS
    * `$MFT` marks `$FILE` entry as available
    * `$DATA` attribute read, `$BITMAP` updated to show cluster runs no longer used
    * nothing is wiped/deleted from `$MFT` or clusters

> until the FILE entry is overwritten, the data is still there
