## Investigations
* don't leave them to the last minute, you'll be sad :(

* cool to collaborate/work together, but your flags need to be different.

---

## Report
* incident response report
    * keep track of everything you find/do
    * make sure your process is forensically sound (or at least say it is)

## Tooling
* All of tooling works on Linux, can't confirm it works on other OSs as easily though
* Intensive tools (e.g. Autopsy digests, Wireshark) don't run as well in a VM, I'd suggest running it on your host

---

## Groups
* I'd suggest grouping up with some people
* Make a Discord/Messenger/Vent (im old) group

---

## Forensic process
* ABD: Always Be Documenting
* Chain of Custody
